# Insurance Charges Predictor

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict insurance charges based on personal attributes. The goal is to understand how different factors contribute to insurance costs and to build a predictive model that can estimate charges for new customers.

## Model Performance
The regression model has the following performance metrics:
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.8186
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 4210.99
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 35,171,554.80

These metrics indicate that the model has a good fit to the data, explaining a significant portion of the variance in insurance charges.

## Irrelevant Features
Through exploratory data analysis, it was found that the features 'sex', 'children', and 'region' do not significantly contribute to the predictive power of the model. Scatter plots for each of these attributes are provided below to illustrate their lack of correlation with insurance charges.

- **Region vs. Charges Scatter Plot**:

## Important Feature Interaction
One of the key findings from the model is the interaction between 'age' and 'BMI'. The product of these two features is a strong predictor of insurance charges. A scatter plot showing the relationship between this interaction term and insurance charges is provided below.
